# Cybersecurity Journey

This repository documents my hands-on cybersecurity learning: cloud security labs (GCP, AWS, Azure), SOC automation, OSINT workflows, red/blue team practice, capture-the-flag notes, and useful scripts/configs.

Structure highlights
- `courses/CloudSecurity-Labs` — cloud labs by provider
- `CyberwarfareLabs` — red/blue team & analyst notes
- `HackTheBox-LinkedInLearning`, `Hackviser-CAPT`, `TryHackMe` — capture-the-flag / platform notes
- `projects/OSINT` — playbooks, automation, sources
- `projects/SOC-Automation` — playbooks and integration configs
- `Scripting` — PowerShell & Python helpers

How to use
1. Browse labs for step-by-step exercises.
2. Run scripts in `Scripting` in a sandboxed lab environment.
3. Reuse playbooks/configs for TheHive, Wazuh, and Shuffle.

Notes
- These notes are for learning and defensive research only. Do not run offensive actions against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.
