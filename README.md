# Cybersecurity Journey

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. This repository tracks my hands-on learning across cloud security, threat detection, SOC engineering, and offensive/defensive cyber operations. It includes:

- **Cloud Security Labs** (GCP, AWS, Azure)
- **Cyberwarfare Labs** (Red/Blue Team)
- **Capture-the-Flag Practice** (HTB, THM, HackViser, CAPT)
- **Projects** (Automation, OSINT, SOC Engineering)
- **Configs + Playbooks**
- **Scripts**
- **Certifications + Roadmap**

Everything here reflects continuous learning, lab execution, notes, diagrams, and configurations I use to grow into a Cloud Security Engineer + Detection Engineer.
